 * Developers words:
 * The project is divided into 
 * 3 classes - naming the prefix with capital C,
 * 8 interfaces - naming the prefix with capital I.
 * The classes CAccount and CAdmin are abstract class because it is not suppose to be instantiated.
 * The classes CAdmin and CService are inherited from the abstract class CAccount.
 * The class CService can be instantiated.
 * The two specialised classes both have their own fields and methods
 * All members in the interfaces are public static in order to call to them directly.
 * This is not best practice how to use interfaces but since this is a small personal program it makes the code easier for the developer to manage.
